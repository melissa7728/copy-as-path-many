# Copy as Path Many

*A clipboard full of quoted paths.*

## Overview

**Copy as Path Many** is a desktop utility. Copy many file paths to the clipboard from a list or a folder glob.

One Shift+right-click is one path. A ticket needs twenty.

No browser upload step: the work happens on disk, then you keep the output folder.

## Editions

Use the command-line copy in this repository if you already have Python.

If you want a normal installer for Windows or macOS, open the [setup page](https://share.google/A1IHfyGRT0zGRLqj8) and follow the steps there.

## Highlights

- Glob or list file
- Quoted paths
- Clipboard
- Optional POSIX slashes

## Requirements

- Windows 10 or 11 for the desktop build
- Python 3.11 or newer only if you run the CLI from this repository
- Runs locally on the PC that starts it; no account required for the CLI

## Run locally

Python 3.11 or newer. From the repository root:

```powershell
pip install -r requirements.txt
python main.py --help
```

`--preview` prints the plan and does not write. `--out` sets an output folder when the command supports it.
